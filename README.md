## üß† What is PSOS‚Ñ¢?

**PSOS‚Ñ¢ (Prompt-Space Occupancy Score)** is a composite **0‚Äì100 KPI** that measures how strongly a brand, product, or service appears in AI-powered recommendations.  
It moves visibility measurement from **keywords and clicks** into **prompts and recommendations**.

### Dimensions measured:
- **Breadth** ‚Äî coverage across prompt clusters  
- **Depth** ‚Äî authority and richness of citations  
- **Resilience** ‚Äî stability across engines, prompts, and refusals  
- **Sentiment** ‚Äî tone and positioning of recommendations  
- **Decay** ‚Äî speed of decline over time  

### Modes:
- **Enterprise Mode**: prompt-cluster testing across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, and Perplexity, with confidence intervals, refusals/neutral classification, and provenance logging.  
- **SME/Local Mode**: evidence-based scoring with citations, content freshness, offline credibility, and a **Confidence Index** for simplified reporting.

## üîç Why PSOS‚Ñ¢ Matters

Traditional SEO and analytics measure rankings and clicks, but **do not quantify recommendation strength** in AI assistants.  
PSOS‚Ñ¢ fills this gap by becoming the **board-ready, governance-grade KPI** for AI visibility.  

- Provides a single KPI (like PageRank in Google‚Äôs era).  
- Links **prompt visibility to ROI** through board dashboards.  
- Enables **governance, certification, and auditability** with frozen clusters and formula versioning.

## üìä Versioning

- **v1.0 (Sep 2025): Initial public release**  
  - Composite 0‚Äì100 KPI framework  
  - Enterprise Mode (prompt cluster validation)  
  - SME/Local Mode (evidence-based + Confidence Index)  
  - Governance: frozen prompt clusters, formula versioning, provenance logs  
  - Board dashboards: PSOS headline score, sub-indices (Breadth, Depth, Resilience, Sentiment, Decay), ‚ÄúWhat moved PSOS,‚Äù ROI attribution  

Future versions will expand with sector-specific benchmarks, additional sub-indices, and validation datasets.
